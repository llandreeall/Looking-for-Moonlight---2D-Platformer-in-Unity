Looking for Moonlight is a 2D platformer game made in Unity and represents the final project I had to make during the 3DPUB summer school.<br>
Our team consisted of three members and all of us wrote code. We would hold discord meeting where one of us would write code and share screen. 
The other two would have to pay attention and help the code writting. This process would rotate so that all of us would write code.<br>
Here you can see a video presenting the project:<br>
